Online Resources
----------------

[The Oxford Classical Dictionary](http://classics.oxfordre.com/), a scholarly and authoritative encyclopedia of all things ancient Greek and Roman.

[The Loeb Classical Library Online](https://www.loebclassics.com/). The LCL has for generations been the go-to collection for reading English translations of ancient texts alongside the original Greek or Latin. Some of the translations are now quite old and correspondingly stilted; but the collection is comprehensive and reliable.

[LacusCurtius](http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/home.html). Many of the same texts appear on the LCL site, but here in a format that some will find more user-friendly. Also includes collections of photos of Latin inscriptions and theatres _inter alia_.
